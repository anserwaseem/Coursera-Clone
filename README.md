# Coursera-Clone

As obvious from the name, this is a clone website of Coursra.

I am starting to build it from plain HTML and CSS. But i'll surely add up Javascript and/or React.js later on. My plan is to use Node.js & Express.js for the backend and MongoDB as a database, but those i still have to learn. I hope that I succeed in learning and improving my skills.
